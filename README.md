Concrete Bridge Deck Crack Detection using Deep Learning

---

## Overview

This project detects cracks on concrete bridge deck surfaces from images.  
It combines two neural networks:

1. **Anomaly Detector** – verifies that the uploaded image is actually a concrete surface  
2. **Crack Detection Model** – classifies the surface as *Cracked* or *Non-Cracked*

A simple Streamlit web app lets users upload an image and instantly get a prediction with confidence score.

---

## Features

- Upload JPG / JPEG / PNG images
- Automatic rejection of non-concrete images (anomaly detection)
- Binary classification: **Cracked** vs **Non-Cracked**
- Confidence score for every prediction
- Handles uncertain predictions (0.4–0.6 range)
- Lightweight and easy to run locally

# EE19-Project — Concrete Bridge Deck Crack Detection

GET 324 mini project for group EE19.

A Streamlit web app that classifies uploaded images of concrete surfaces as **Cracked** or **Non-Cracked**. Before classification, an anomaly-detection autoencoder first checks whether the uploaded image actually looks like a concrete surface, to reduce false predictions on irrelevant images.

## How it works

1. **Anomaly check** — An autoencoder (`anomalyDetector.keras`) reconstructs the uploaded image. If the reconstruction error exceeds a stored threshold (`anomalyThreshold.txt`), the app rejects the image as "not a concrete surface."
2. **Crack classification** — If the image passes the anomaly check, a CNN classifier (`crackDetectionModel.keras`) predicts whether the surface is cracked or non-cracked.
3. **Confidence handling** — Predictions with confidence between 0.4 and 0.6 are flagged as uncertain, prompting the user to try a clearer image.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shugabright565/EE19-Project.git
cd EE19-Project/EE19
pip install streamlit numpy pillow tensorflow
```

### Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local URL Streamlit prints (typically `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Launch the app.
2. Upload an image of a concrete surface (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`).
3. The app will:
   - Reject the image if it doesn't resemble a concrete surface.
   - Otherwise, display a prediction of **Cracked** or **Non-Cracked** with a confidence score.

## Model details

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Input image size | 120 × 120 |
| Classes | `Non-Cracked`, `Cracked` |
| Pixel normalization | 0–1 (divided by 255.0) |
| Uncertain prediction range | 0.4 – 0.6 confidence |

# Concrete Crack Detection System

> A lightweight vision pipeline that tells you, from a single photo, whether a concrete surface is cracked — and how confident it is about that call.

## Why This Project Exists

Cracks in concrete are one of the earliest visible signs of structural fatigue, and catching them early is far cheaper than repairing what they eventually lead to. Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and doesn't scale — two inspectors can look at the same wall and disagree. This project explores a small, practical question: **can a lightweight model do a first-pass triage of crack images reliably enough to be useful in the field?**

The result is a two-stage pipeline rather than a single classifier — a design choice explained below.

## How It Actually Works

Most crack-detection demos stop at "load a CNN, predict, done." This one adds a check *before* that step:

1. **Anomaly gate.** Before trusting the crack classifier's verdict, the image is passed through an autoencoder-style anomaly detector. It reconstructs the input and measures how far off the reconstruction is (`reconError`). If an image looks nothing like the surfaces the model was trained on — a random object, a blurry photo, the wrong kind of material entirely — the reconstruction error spikes and the app can flag it as out-of-distribution instead of confidently guessing wrong.
2. **Crack classification.** Only after that sanity check does the image go to the dedicated CNN that decides **Cracked** vs **Non-Cracked**, returning a confidence score alongside the label.

This two-stage approach — gatekeeper model, then specialist model — is the core design decision that separates this from a plain single-model classifier, and it's the part worth highlighting if you're comparing it against similar projects.

## Project Structure

```
EE19/
├── app.py                     # Streamlit application (UI + inference pipeline)
├── crackDetectionModel.keras  # CNN trained to classify Cracked / Non-Cracked
├── anomalyDetector.keras      # Autoencoder used as the out-of-distribution gate
└── anomalyThreshold.txt       # Reconstruction-error cutoff for the anomaly gate
```

## Running It

```bash
pip install streamlit tensorflow numpy pillow
streamlit run app.py
```

Upload an image of a concrete surface at the prompt. The app resizes it to 120×120, normalizes it, runs it through the anomaly gate, then the crack classifier, and returns a labeled prediction with a confidence percentage.

## Design Notes & Honest Limitations

- The model works on still images only — no video stream or live camera support yet.
- Confidence scores reflect the classifier's certainty, not a physical measurement of crack severity (width, depth, length aren't estimated).
- The anomaly threshold is a fixed value read from `anomalyThreshold.txt` rather than dynamically calibrated per deployment — worth tuning if you retrain on a different dataset.

## Possible Extensions

Ideas for anyone building on this: heatmap visualization of *where* the crack was detected (Grad-CAM), batch image processing with a results table, or a rough severity score derived from pixel-level crack geometry.
